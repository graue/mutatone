# Mutatone

Mutatone generates melodies using evolutionary algorithms.

[Try it out here](http://toxicsli.me/mutatone). Click the Play button
for each melody, then select your two favorites and click on the Breed
button for each one. New offspring melodies appear! Repeat.

This is written in ClojureScript using the new HTML5 Web Audio API,
which both Chrome and Firefox now support.

I ([@graue](https://github.com/graue)) wrote it at the December 2013
[NYC Monthly Music Hackathon](http://monthlymusichackathon.org), where
the theme was "Automatic Music". You can [see many other cool hacks
here](https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/automatic-music-hackathon/hacks).
(Check out H.C.K.T., Browser FX Pedal and the tic-tac-toe hack.) Many
thanks to the hackathon organizers and sponsors for providing the space
and motivation to make this.
